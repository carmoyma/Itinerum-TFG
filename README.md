# Itinerum

This is my final project before finishing the DAW (Web Application Development) course.  
It’s a web app that lets you **search places of interest in Málaga** and create your own **custom itinerary**.  
You can also save your itineraries and check them later.

## What it does
- Search for different points of interest in Málaga
- Create a personalized itinerary from the search results
- Save itineraries to the database
- View previously saved itineraries
- Simple and clean interface for both desktop and mobile

## Tech used
- **HTML5** – Structure and content  
- **CSS3** – Styles and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – Dynamic search and interactivity  
- **PHP** – Server-side logic and database interaction  
- **MySQL** – Store itineraries and places of interest  

## How to try it
1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carmoyma/Itinerum-TFG.git
